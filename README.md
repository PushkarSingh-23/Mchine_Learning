# Mchine_Learning
Project = BREAST CANCER PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
I have used Jupyter notebook extension on VSC to perform this task.
Data = I have used a dataset from Kaggle which I imported on my local machine using Kaggle API which I had already downloaded for my previous task so I have just loaded that downloaded file in the project using pandas.
PROPOSED METHODOLOGY = 1)Pre-Processing Data
2) DATA PREPARATION
3) FEATURES SELECTION
(Attribute Information: 1) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign)
4) Feature Projection
5) Feature Scaling
6)Model Selection(supervised)
7)PREDICTION
Method used = Logistic Regression

please ignore Spotify in BG :)
